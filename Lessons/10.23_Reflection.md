# Reflection

1) What worked well?

R\\ During Unit-1 I adapted to Python language, therefore, I started to develop myself in a better way than at the 
beginning. I practiced with Snackify that helped me a lot to know more about Python and have everything clear to future
projects.

2) What did not work well?

R\\ At the beginning the flow charts, but then I figure it out with seniors and I developed myself in this area. Probably,
I did not give the enough time to practice, therefore, sometime I got stuck with some quizzes. The last thing was my
documentation, I needed to give the information asked, not more, not less, and probably it could be better if I asked more
seniors for feedback.

3) What is your goal for Unit 2?

R\\ Improve on my documentation for the next project, trying to give more time after class to keep everything fresh

4) How do you plan on achieving the goal?

R\\ Asking feedback to my seniors and trying to fulfill the requirements. Give more time to practice.
