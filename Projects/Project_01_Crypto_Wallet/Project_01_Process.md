# Criteria A: Planning
## Problem Definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell 
electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which 
is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms. Sato to find past transactions or 
important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the 
cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.

## Proposed Solution

### Design Statement

I will to design and make a Python Code for a client who is really interested in Cryptocurrencies. The Cryptocurrency that 
I am going to use is Cardano (ADA), For this Software I will be using Python 3.9. on PyCharm 23.2.1. running this on a MacBook Air model 2017. 
It will take approximately two weeks, and it is going to be evaluated with the criteria that is set below. Also, the customer 
needs to know every transaction, and keep everything organized, so the code will have organization, in consequence, the customer can 
access to this information without problem. I will be using Python because the customer wants a software that can be run on an 
effective way by the effective coding and with a clear idea of what the customer wants. PyCharm gives the client a 
better experience, making our life easier to understand the different things that the project have. This software can be 
run without problems on Windows, Linux and different operative systems. The costumer just need to have PyCharm to run the 
software, it not requires higher requirements, because the tools that are going to be used are simple, therefore, the 
program can be run on a computer with low-high statistics. Moreover, the program is always telling the costumer what to do, 
with the different options, so it is easy to understand every procedure and the customer will not have complications.


### Description of the Currency

Cardano sees itself as a third-generation blockchain platform designed to overcome the limitations of earlier blockchains 
like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Launched in 2017, Cardano seeks to offer a more scalable, sustainable, and interoperable solution 
for blockchain. Unlike some projects focusing solely on code development, Cardano emphasises fact-finding and analysis, 
aiming to create a robust foundation through scientific scrutiny and peer-reviewed academic research[^2]. Besides being an 
innovative blockchain project, Cardano has some catalysts on the horizon, namely increased developer activity, that could 
catapult its price higher. Investors who purchase its tokens now have the advantage of buying in at a much lower entry point, 
which increases their potential upside[^3].

### Description of my Software
My software is named Cardinity, where the function of this software is to have a record of transactions that the customer 
have with the Crypto Coin of Cardano. This have different options that the customer can do. The first thing that you can 
do is have your procedures in a Safe Place, because you need to log-in by a username and a password that only the customer 
know. In the case that the customer forget the password, after three attempts, the user can recover the password by following 
the steps that are showed on the software. Besides, the program is giving different options to keep track of every process,
that the customer make, like deposits, withdrawals, etc., even if the user wants to know the transaction made on certain day. 
In addition, it also shows information about the coin, and can print every transaction made into a pdf, so the customer 
can have everything recorded. 

### Justification
PyCharm is considered to be one of the most integrated Python IDEs, offering a range of modules and tools which make coding 
a lot faster and easier for programmers. It offers support for both Python 2 (2.7) and Python 3 (3.5 and above) versions 
and can be used on a multitude of platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS[^4]. PyCharm has many advantages. Its intelligent 
code editor helps to write high quality code. Its different color codes for keywords, classes and functions increase the 
readability and understandability of the code. This also simplifies error detection. An autocomplete feature is also included.
Code navigation features help developers to edit and improve code effortlessly, and to easily navigate to a function, 
class or file. Locating an element, symbol or variable in the source code is very simple, and the lens mode allows to inspect 
and debug the entire source code. Refactoring allows quick and efficient changes to local or global variables. Developers 
can improve the internal structure without changing the external performance of the code[^5].

# Criteria C: Development
## Existing tools
| Libraries |
|-----------|
| Datetime  |
| Requests  |
| Time      |
| Os        |
| Pandas    |

## List of techniques used
1. For Loops (To make a process several times, like look into the lines of the files) 
2. If statements (To access to the different options. Moreover, to show or return some values if a statement is T or F)
3. Input validation (To see if the value entered is correct using 'While' loop)
4. Dictionaries (To give the parameters of the information that I want to get)
5. Web scraping (To get information from a website)
6. Reporting (To creat a CSV into a PDF)
7. Encryption (To Log-In with a username and password)

## Development
### Words file
In this part of the code I have every phrase that I am using on the python code. I took this from a csv file named `Project_01_Words1.csv"`
I open this file as a 'read' mode. In addition, I use `words = words_file.readlines()` to read each line of the code. 
So everytime that you see a 'words[x + 1]' where 'x' is the number of the 'phrase' that I want to show.
```.py
with open("../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Words1.csv", mode="r") as words_file:
    words = words_file.readlines()
```
### Cardano Information 'Option 1' (Success Criteria #2)
Here is where I use the library of 'requests' that helps to extract information from a website, therefore this information
is taken from the website 'Coingecko' I take the information with `response = requests.get(website, params=info_wanted)`
then with the dictionary 'info_wanted' I give the parameters or the info that I want to get from the website. `"vs_currency": "usd",`
is establishing a relation between the Crypto Coin and USD. `"ids": "cardano",` 'ids' refers that I want the information
from Cardano. `"order": "market_cap_desc",` 'order' as the name says, it is to order the information per capitalization.
`"per_page": 1, "page": 1,` means that I want to get information 1 per one, but in the second line I tell the program to
look just in the first page.`"sparkline": False` is in False, because I do not want to print a Graph. Finally, 
`if response.status_code == 200:` this want to measure that we get the information successfully.

```.py
website = "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets"
info_wanted = {
    "vs_currency": "usd",
    "ids": "cardano", 
    "order": "market_cap_desc", 
    "per_page": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "sparkline": False
}
# Requesting the information from the website
response = requests.get(website, params=info_wanted)
# Success asking the request
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()[0]
```
### Transactions 'Option 3' and 'Option 4' (Success Criteria #3)
This is the code for Deposits. It starts with the function named `valid_value` which is validating the value entered by the
customer. If the user enters a letter or a negative value, it will display an error and have the opportunity to enter another
value. When the value is validated, the program will record the day with the library datetime `date = datetime.date.today()`.
Then, with the function `reason_transaction` the user needs to enter the reason of the deposit, this with numbers. Inside
this function I have another funtion named `valid_number` which measures if the value entered is valid.

```.py
amount = valid_value(msg=words[32])
date = datetime.date.today()
reason = reason_transaction(list=["Work Payment", "Sales", "Luck", "Owed Money", "Others"])
```

For the withdrawals I start by opening the file 'Project_01_Account_Management.csv' in read mode, and I split the values
that I have divided by a ',' and I take the 2nd value, because is the place where the transactions are recorded. Then
I add this values and put them in 'balance'.
```.py
with open("../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Account_Management.csv", mode='r') as file:
    balance_file = file.readlines()
balance = 0
for line in balance_file:
    # The values that I get from the split
    date, amount, reason = line.strip().split(",")
    balance += float(amount)
```
In addition, I use another time the function `valid_value` to see if the value is valid. Then with a 'while' loop I measure 
if the value is higher than the value in balance. If this is 'True' It will ask another time, until the statement is 'False'
Finally I record the day of the transaction and I use the function `reason_transaction` to keep the data well organized.
```.py
withdraw_amount = valid_value(msg=words[39])
while float(withdraw_amount) > balance:
    print(words[44].strip())
    withdraw_amount = float(input(words[45]))
date = datetime.date.today()
reason = reason_transaction(list=["Payments", "Stuff", "Kombini", "Travels", "Others"])
```
The file that I use is named 'Project_01_Account_Management.csv' and with this part of the code `manage_file.writelines(line)`
I can save and record the data with 'writelines'. The part of '(line)' means the format that I introduce.
```.py
with open("../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Account_Management.csv", mode="a") as manage_file:
    manage_transactions = manage_file.writelines(line)
```
### CSV into PDF Option '6' (Success criteria #4)
I start with putting the file route in 'csv_file', then with the library 'pandas as pd' `pd.read_csv(csv_file)` I read the file. 
With `[read_csv.columns.tolist()]` the program take how many columns should have the table and with `read_csv.values.tolist()` 
I put the info that the program find. Next with the library 'os' I can direct where I want to download the PDF, in this case 
in 'Downloads' `os.path.expanduser("~/Downloads")`. Also `os.path.join(download_path, "Account_Management.pdf")` this give
the opportunity to make the 'download_path' and name the pdf.
```.py
csv_file = "/Users/m19-056/PycharmProjects/pythonProject1/Unit1/Projects/Project_01_Crypto_Wallet/Project_01_Files/Project_01_Account_Management.csv"
read_csv = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
info = [read_csv.columns.tolist()] + read_csv.values.tolist()
download_path = os.path.expanduser("~/Downloads")
pdf = os.path.join(download_path, "Account_Management.pdf")
```
Now talking about the design of the information that I want to print, with the library `from reportlab.lib.pagesizes 
import letter` and `from reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate` I can put the size of the PDF. With `from 
reportlab.platypus import Table` and `table = Table(info)` I can make a table with the information that is on 
the CSV. Talking about the style of the table I use the library `from reportlab.platypus import TableStyle` Each line is
well identified of what I want to reach and talking about the numbers, everytime you see a number (in the first part) o 
'-1' in the (second part) refers that I want to put that option in my table, for example: `('BACKGROUND', (0, 1), (-1, -1), colors.white),` 
In the first part, I put '(0,1)' the '0' is where the index starts, then '1' means the start of the range that I want for 
the background, starting from 2, because the index starts from '0'. In the second part I put '(-1,-1)', this means that I
want to apply the color white as my background from the beginning to the end. I can choose the color with the library
`from reportlab.lib import colors`. Finally, with `table.setStyle(print_format)` I set al the changes in my table.
```.py
doc = SimpleDocTemplate(pdf, pagesize=letter)
table = Table(info)
# Complete style of the table
print_format = TableStyle([
    ('ALIGN', (0, 0), (-1, -1), 'CENTER'),
    ('FONTNAME', (0, 0), (-1, 0), 'Helvetica-Bold'),
    ('BOTTOMPADDING', (0, 0), (-1, 0), 12),
    ('BACKGROUND', (0, 1), (-1, -1), colors.white),
    ('GRID', (0, 0), (-1, -1), 1, colors.black)
])
# Save the format and changes
table.setStyle(print_format)
```
### Search by date 'Option 5' (Success Criteria #5)
The program gives the opportunity to see the transactions that the user made on certain day. Starting with a function
`date_comparison` that is to measure that the date entered is correct, if it is not correct, it will keep asking until it
is a valid value. Then, it will enter into the file 'Project_01_Account_Management' and split the values divided by ',' and
take the first value, this to compare with the returned information of the function 'date_comparison'. If there are transactions
on that day, it will print all the transaction in that day, otherwise, it will print nothing.
```.py
date_correct = date_comparison(msg=words[47])
with open("../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Account_Management.csv", mode='r') as file:
    view_transactions = file.readlines()
for line in view_transactions:
    date = line.split(",")[0]
    amount = line.split(",")[1]
    reason = line.split(",")[2].strip()
    if date == date_correct:
        print(f"{date} {amount} ADA {reason}")
```
Here is the function `date_comparison`. At the beginning I tell the costumer to enter a date with the format YYYY-MM-DD,
then I split the division with '-' if the splits are 3, it will continue with the program, if not, it will ask another time
until the splits are 3 . Then I split the values into 'year', 'month' and 'day', and I verify if these values are digits. If
they are digits, the function will continue, otherwise it will ask another time. If the format is not followed, I print 
'Please follow the format'. Finally, I compare if the day is less or equal to 31 and greater or equal to 1, and month less 
or equal tan 12 and greater or equal to 12. If everything is correct, it will return the date entered.
```.py
def date_comparison(msg: str) -> str:
    while True:
        date_search = input(msg)
        splits_date = date_search.split("-")
        if len(splits_date) == 3:
            year, month, day = splits_date
            if day.isdigit() and month.isdigit() and year.isdigit():

### Password Recover (Success Criteria #6)
One of my success criteria was the option to recover the password by answering some questions that were asked at the registration,
this begins due to a mistake made in the Log-In, so after 3 attempts, the user will have the option to recover the password.
I define the function `recover_password` where the user needs to input the username and the answers of the questions. Then 
I open a file with the line code `with open('../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Users_Logged.csv', mode='r') as f:` where I 
have all the data of the users. Then I use a 'for' loop to split each line of the '.csv' file and I take the first value 
of this, so I can compare the username and take the line that is the same as the username. Therefore, I can compare each
answer of the questions, with the data that I have on the file. If everything is correct, it will show the password. However,
if something is bad, it will print that the person should make an account.

```.py
def recover_password(msg1: str, msg2: str, msg3: str, msg4: str, msg5: str) -> str:
    user_val = input(msg1)
    q1 = input(msg2).lower()
    q2 = input(msg3).lower()
    q3 = input(msg4).lower()
    q4 = input(msg5).lower()
    with open('../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Users_Logged.csv', mode='r') as f:
        data = f.readlines()
    show_password = ""
    for line in data:
        line_user = line.strip().split(",")
        # Taking just the first value of the split
        user_correct = line_user[0].strip()
        if user_correct == user_val:
            #Giving values to each split
            ques1, ques2, ques3, ques4 = line_user[2], line_user[3], line_user[4], line_user[5]
            if ques1 == q1 and ques2 == q2 and ques3 == q3 and ques4 == q4:
                show_password += f"{words[19]}{line_user[1]}\n{words[20]}"
                break
            else:
                show_password += f"{words[59]}"
    return show_password
```
## Sign-In system
I start this process by asking if the customer wants to create an account or wants to Log-In. If the user wants to create
an account, the person needs to put a username and a password. With a function named `uname_repeated` I look into the database
and compare the usernames, if there is a username with the same name, the program will print that the username is already
being used.
```.py
user_repeat = input(words[5])
valid_uname = uname_repeated(uname=user_repeat)
while valid_uname == True:
    print(words[41].strip())
    user_repeat = input(words[5])
    valid_uname = uname_repeated(uname=user_repeat)
```
Then for the password, the client needs to fulfill some requirements, such us the password needs to contain at least 7
characters, one lower letter and one upper letter. With the functon `validate_pass` I see if the password entered has the
correct format. If not, it will keep asking. 
```.py
pass_test = input(words[7])
passw = validate_pass(upass=pass_test)
# It will keep asking if validate_pass is False
while not passw:
    print(f"ERROR! {words[6].strip()}")
    pass_test = input(words[7])
    passw = validate_pass(upass=pass_test)
```
This is the function of `validate_pass`, when if the password follows the format, the program will continue. Nevertheless,
if something is missing it will keep asking.
```.py
def validate_pass(upass:str) -> bool:
    upper, lower, num = False, False, False
    count = 0
    for letter in upass:
        count += 1
        if letter.isupper():
            upper = True
        elif letter.islower():
            lower = True
        elif letter.isnumeric():
            num = True
    if count < 7:
        return False
    # If all values are True, it will return true, otherwise, False.
    return upper and lower and num
```
Finally, if everything is good, the program will ask the personal questions, and keep all the data recorded on a CSV file,
named 'Project_01_Users_Logged'. All the information is separated by ','.
```.py
for n in range(9, 13):
    answers_recover = input(words[n])
    answers += answers_recover + ","

with open("../Project_01_Files/Project_01_Users_Logged.csv", mode="a") as user_file:
    user_file.writelines(f"{user_repeat},{pass_test},{answers.lower()}\n")
```
## Leave program function
I define the function `project_leave` and I print the options that the user have. Then I use another function named `valid_number`
that watch if the value entered is correct or not, it will continue asking until the vale is correct. Furthermore, If the
customer enters '1' it will return to the main menu, otherwise, the program will break completely with a message made by
another function named `frame_maker`.
```.py
def project_leave():
    print(words[35].strip())
    print(words[36])
    number = valid_number(msg=words[3], valid="12")
    if number == '1':
        return words[37] #Break the 'if' of the options and returns to the main menu
    elif number == "2":
        print(frame_maker(msg=words[52].strip(), sym="*", space=50, num=5))
    return exit(1) # Break the hole program
```
