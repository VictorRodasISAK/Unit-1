What Is Cardano (ADA)?

Cardano (ADA) is a decentralized proof of stake (PoS) blockchain designed to be a more efficient alternative to proof of work (PoW) networks.
Cardano’s cryptocurrency is named Ada after Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815–1852), who is commonly regarded as the first computer programmer.
Ada is used in the blockchain’s PoS consensus mechanism. It is given as a reward for work done for the blockchain by users participating in a stake pool.


History of Cardano (ADA)

Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum, began the development of Cardano in 2015 and launched the platform in 2017 Cardano has positioned itself as an alternative to Ethereum.
Both platforms are used for similar applications, such as smart contracts, and have goals of building a connected and decentralized system.
Cardano considers itself an updated version of Ethereum and has anointed itself a “third-generation” platform, compared with Ethereum’s “second-generation” credentials.
The blockchain platform also has a goal of providing banking services to the world’s unbanked.


Future of Cardano
Cardano is designed to be developed in “eras” named after notable figures in poetry and computer science history: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.
Basho is the era of scaling and optimization, intended to bring more capabilities to Cardano. As of 2023, Cardano is anticipating the transition from Basho to Voltaire.
Voltaire is the final era for Cardano development, intended to bring voting and treasury management of the blockchain and network through previously introduced smart contract functionality and system improvements.
